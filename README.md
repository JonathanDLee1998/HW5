Thank you again  for the extention Ma'am, I really appreciate it. The method uses a stack to handle opening and closing parentheses. When an opening parenthesis ((, {, [) is encountered, it gets pushed onto the stack. For a closing parenthesis (), }, ]), the method checks if it matches the last opened one by comparing it to the top of the stack. If they don't match, the expression is unbalanced. After processing the entire string, if the stack is empty, the expression is balanced; if not, it's unbalanced. One of the challenges was ensuring that different types of parentheses were properly matched and nested. This was managed using a simple switch-case structure to compare each closing parenthesis with its corresponding opening one. I also handled edge cases, such as an empty string, which is automatically considered balanced. The method was thoroughly tested with various scenarios, including simple and complex expressions, both balanced and unbalanced, as well as an empty string. The tests confirmed that the method accurately determines whether the parentheses in the expression are balanced. Overall, this project demonstrated the usefulness of stacks in solving problems that involve matching and nesting, such as checking for balanced parentheses in an expression.
